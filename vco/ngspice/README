1. Monte-carlo simulation
     
	This simulation you should change some semiconductor fabication corner and temprature in opration time of VCO.

a. Corner
	sky130nm pdk libary include mismatch conditions and corner of fabication. You shoud simulation with these corner to guarantee that your design can run exactly if fabication process isn't perfect.
	130nm library file:/home/dkits/efabless/open_pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/ngspice/sky130.lib.spicult1 result2 > ./corner_dir/temp_aa.txt
 content the corners:
*		     * Typical corner (tt)
*                    * Slow-Fast corner (sf)
*                    * Fast-Fast corner (ff)
*                    * Slow-Slow corner (ss)
*                    * Fast-Slow corner (fs)
*                    * Low-Low corner (ll)
*                    * High-High corner (hh)
*                    * High-Low corner (hl)
*                    * Low-High corner (lh)

You can set Typycal cornner in file: ring_osc_tb.spice like below example:
.lib /home/dkits/efabless/open_pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/ngspice/sky130.lib.spice tt

b. Temperature
	This simulations sweep temperature from -25*c to 140*c and confirm that your circuit works well for the normal temperature.
In this simulation, you can change temperature in file ring_osc_tb.spice from 0*c to 120*c:
For example 25*c:  
.temp 25


c. Organize file and directory for Monte-carlo simulations
For each corner, you should create a directory and save all result file of change temprature simulations in this directory. Name of directory you can create like: "typical_corner", and change in .control conditions like that:

print result1 result2 > ./corner_dir/temp_aa.txt

where	corner_dir: directory for corner
	temp_aa.txt: result file of aa temperarure
	result1, result2: results of this simulation
example:
print Vin freq > ./typical_corner/temp_25.txt

/!\ Before simulate, you must create directory by terminal like that:
	$mkdir typical_corner

2. Find value of tail resitors (option)
*Change temperatures: 0:5:120 (0, 5, 10, ...., 120) 
.temp 25
